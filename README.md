# Prequistes 

## What you should know

 - Basics on Blockchain
 - https://etherscan.io/

## What you need
 - Diamond Hands üíéü§≤

# Coding on the Blockchain

 ## üòà Some bad things 
- its weird: No Apis, No Infinte Loops( which is why gas is important).
    Difficult to update. Gotta be very secure. No Randomness.
- Its like a mechanic designing an engine and 
        having nightmares about low mileage.
- Also you can't store a lot data on it
 
 ## üçë Some nice things 
- Its like Legos: But infinitely better and complex
- No trust 
- Always live 
- Can make you very very very rich

 ## EVM

- Comparable to Java Virtual Machine(JVM)
- Solidity Code <-> EVM Compatible Bytecode <-> Assembly Code.
- Designed for Smart Contracts. Not Applications.
